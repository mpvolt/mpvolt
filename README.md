- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang at the moment by reading Head First Go. Once I finish, I will move on to learning the Cosmos SDK, an sdk for a blockchain interoperabiliy protocal that I'm very interested in. Once I've built my first Cosmos app, I will start learning Rust and continue to built on other platforms like Solana and Matic/Polygon
